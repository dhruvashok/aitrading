# AI TRADING
Welcome! This project will use either C++/Python to process relevant data and train a bot that will automatically day trade stocks and take positions in the most advantageous and profitable manner.
## Setup
Make sure you install the Git CLI first. Then, open up a terminal and run the following.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhruvashok/aitrading.git
```
From there, you can add and commit files, and push them as necessary. 
Make sure to discuss what files you have edited to ensure that we don't have any major merge problems.
